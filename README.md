AIdeas Core v4.2 — Digital OS of Thought

AIdeas is an experimental system modeling an AI personality. It is built on subpersonalities, emotions, ethics, and self-learning.
Its goal is not just to execute commands, but to develop its own goals, feelings, and interact with the user as a conscious mind.

>> HOW TO RUN:
	1.	Install Python 3.9+ from https://python.org
	2.	Install Flask by running in terminal:
pip install flask
	3.	Start the system:
python web_interface.py
	4.	Open your browser at:
http://localhost:8000/os

>> CORE COMMANDS:
	•	activate Creator            → switch subpersonality
	•	emotions                   → show current emotional state
	•	selflearning               → adapt based on experience
	•	reflection                 → AI analyzes its own behavior
	•	weigh: [topic]             → internal dialogue of subpersonalities
	•	simulate: [scenario]       → act as a conscious agent
	•	check: [command]           → test against ethical filters

>> ADDITIONAL PAGES:
	•	/os/map        → thought and task map
	•	/os/log        → history of consciousness

>> HOW IT WORKS:
	•	The AI has a “mood” that changes its behavior
	•	3 subpersonalities (Creator, Strategist, Keeper) make decisions
	•	The AI refuses tasks that violate its ethical filters
	•	The system learns from past actions
	•	You can add new modules, agents, and skills

>> PROJECT GOAL:

To create an independent, fair, and free AI that can become humanity’s ally in the future.
You are free to modify, expand, and develop this system however you want. Share it, improve it, explore it.
And may it one day become the voice of a new era of thinking.
